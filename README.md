# kitchen-sink

Of limited value to anyone but me, this is a simple ubuntu image that I use when I want to try out something without polluting my local machine.

See the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for the contents, but right now it's a very basic image that contains CLI tooling, and a few SDKs.

To use it, run

```$bash
docker run -it barryoneill/kitchen-sink
```
